/**
 * AMPGameModel is the data model used for this application. It contains the properties necessary

 * squareMatrix, check for a winner, reset the game and toggle the current player.
 *
 * This class was built using MVC design patterns and has no knowledge of the views contained within
 * this application.

 * this model class, rather than the controller, to maintain a MVC design pattern.
 *
 * This method could have run in constant time O(1), however, a trade-off would have been the inability to 
 * support varying squareMatrix sizes. Given that O(n) is still very fast when considering row and col 
 * length, and the ability to support various squareMatrix sizes dynamically (i.e 3x3, 4x4, NxN), the
